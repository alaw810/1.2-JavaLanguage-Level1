## üìÑ Description ‚Äì Exercise Statement

- Create a class `Product` with the following attributes:
    - `name`
    - `price`

- Create another class `Sale` with:
    - A collection of products
    - An attribute to store the total price of the sale

- The `Sale` class must include a method `calculateTotal()` that:
    - Throws a custom exception called `EmptySaleException` if the product collection is empty
    - If the collection contains products, it iterates through them and stores the sum of their prices in the total price attribute

- The custom exception `EmptySaleException` must extend `Exception` and receive a message in its constructor:
  > "To make a sale you first have to add products"

- When the exception is caught, the message should be printed using the `getMessage()` method

- Finally, write code that triggers and catches an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` to demonstrate the ability to handle built-in exceptions as well

This exercise focuses on **custom exception creation and handling**, **defensive programming**, and **error management in collection-based operations**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

1. Open the Main.java file

2. Run the main() method

3. You should see output similar to:

>Error: To make a sale you first have to add products  
The final total is: 6.09  
Value at: 0 = Product{name='Apple', price=0.89}  
Value at: 1 = Product{name='Banana', price=0.3}  
Value at: 2 = Product{name='Pineapple', price=4.9}  
IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 3 out of bounds for length 3
